Solving Advent of Code 2021 to improve my R skills.
I picked two guiding principles for this project.  
  (1) Solutions should as much as possible be based on a "dataset"-based logic with variables, cases and summary statistics, as opposed to more classical algorithmic approaches such as traversals, iterations and recursion.  
  (2) Solutions should experiment with different degrees of statement complexity. How readable is the code if I use the pipe operator a lot vs. regular R assignments.
